Welcome to CX-ASAP!
===================

Introduction
------------

CX-ASAP is a collection of modules and pipelines designed to automate crystallographic analysis. It is particularly useful for automatically analysing large datasets where experiments have been performed on the same crystal. Consider using this software if you regularly perform experiments such as:

* Variable Temperature Studies
* Variable Pressure Studies
* Positional Mapping Studies
